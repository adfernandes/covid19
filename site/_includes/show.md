These plots show the **cumulative** number of people confirmed to be infected with *SARS-CoV-2*{:.sc} virus or dead as a result of *COVID-19*{:.sc} disease. The number of people recovered is not shown because including them makes the plots visually confusing.

Because these are cumulative counts, they never go down. Fortunately, when the lines flatten out it means that no new new infections or deaths are being reported. _Death counts are likely to be vastly understated_ because death is often a result of _unconfirmed_ *SARS-CoV-2*{:.sc} infection or as an _indirect_ consequence of *COVID-19*{:.sc} disease.

Remember, testing for *SARS-CoV-2*{:.sc} is very sporadic. So the population counts are [_confounded_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding) with both the availability of testing kits and strongly-regional policies about who gets tested at what time for what reason. So both "confirmed" and "deaths" counts are likely _vaslty understated_, with the death count being even more artificially low than the "confirmed" case count.

That's why testing, which is missing in much of the world, is so important.
