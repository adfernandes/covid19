A wonderful, well-rounded primer has been written by [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/03/dont-panic-the-comprehensive-ars-technica-guide-to-the-coronavirus/).

The Internet is full of dire warnings about the upcoming surge of *SARS-CoV-2*{:.sc} infections. [Article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/) after [article](https://covidactnow.org) after [article](https://www.ft.com/coronavirus-latest) warn of a huge and sudden increase in *SARS-CoV-2*{:.sc} infections. For most of us, the "exponential blow-up" of the pandemic must ultimately be taken as a matter of faith.

There are already several [easy-to-understand](https://youtu.be/fgBla7RepXU), [non-mathematical](https://youtu.be/gxAaO2rsdIs), and [more-mathematical](https://youtu.be/Kas0tIxDvrg) online explanations of disease transmission and the growth of epidemics. But I wanted to make things _even simpler_, and remove some of the "mathematical magic" behind the dire pandemic predictions. And the simplest thing I could think of was plotting some points and drawing straight lines.

The trick is to scale the number of cases by "order of magnitude". We know that 1,000 people is ten times the magnitude of 100, and we know that 10,000 people is ten times the magnitude of 1,000. And it turns that if we plot the _magnitude_ of *covid-19*{:.sc} infections over time, it is easier to understand how the epidemic is behaving. We can use the past behavior to predict the epidemic will _likely_ behave in the future.

So simply plotting the data and looking at it should be enough to convince almost anyone that we should be very worried indeed. Especially since our population counts are likely [vast underestimates](https://youtu.be/mCa0JXEwDEk).
